# Data-Analytics
 
Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. You work closely with the ops team, support team, marketing team, etc and help them derive insights out of the data they collect.

In this project, we are going to identify the multiple operational metrices about daily engagements which will help other teams in answering the questions like what is daily engagement, is there any dip in user activity etc..

Here, we are working on 4 datasets namely -
    1. Case_Study_1
    2. events
    3. email_events
    4. Users

All these databases are attached to the repository for replication purpose. 

I have also attached dump file for creating this datasets directly to this repository.

Operation & Metric Analytics.sql file is added which has all the source code associated with execution of commands.
Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike.pdf file has detailed project along with solutions. 

***** This project has been uploaded for information purpose and I want to share and explore my skills at the same time. ****
